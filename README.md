Platform Game
==============

AP Computer Science -- Final Project (Fall 2013)
--------------

Platform Game is a simple puzzle-based platformer written in Java.

I wrote this for my final project in AP Computer Science during my senior year in high school.

The goal in Platform Game is to reach the flag at the end of each level, collecting as many coins as you can along the way.

You must work your way through many challenges, like finding keys, moving boxes around, solving visual puzzles, and more.

Features include:

  * Interactive tiles, so the player can change the world as needed to solve the puzzles
  * A custom file format, so levels can be added easily, including programmable player interactions
  * A complete tile set, including animated tiles, message signs, coins, buttons, doors, and more
  * A high score table, so players can compete for the best scores
  * And more!
